# CRM-based Large Language Model for Enterprise Ticket Resolution

## Overview
This project integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) into a CRM-based system to automate and enhance the efficiency of resolving customer support tickets. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, the system provides timely, accurate, and personalized responses to customer inquiries, significantly reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.

## Features
- **Automatic Ticket Categorization:** Utilizes LLM to analyze and categorize incoming tickets based on their content, ensuring they are directed to the appropriate department or personnel.
- **AI-driven Response Suggestions:** Generates response suggestions for customer support representatives, reducing the time needed to draft replies.
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis:** Employs sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction and prioritize tickets based on urgency and emotional tone.
- **Self-service Portal Integration:** Provides customers with AI-generated solutions and answers through a self-service portal, reducing the volume of incoming tickets.
- **Continuous Learning:** Learns from interactions to improve response accuracy and customer service quality over time.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Offers insights into ticket resolution metrics, customer satisfaction scores, and AI performance, helping managers make informed decisions.
